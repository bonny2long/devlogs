    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>Bonny Makaniankhondo</strong>, an aspiring Full Stack
      Developer dedicated to building meaningful, data-driven, and user-focused
      applications. Through my journey at
      <strong> i.c.stars Chicago</strong>, I’ve learned how technology and
      leadership work hand in hand to create impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently deepening my expertise across both frontend and backend
      development — from working with <strong>React</strong> and{" "}
      <strong>Node.js</strong> to leveraging
      <strong> SQL</strong>, <strong>Power BI</strong>, and{" "}
      <strong>Azure AI</strong> for smarter, scalable systems. One of the
      highlights of my journey so far has been contributing to
      <em> SyncUp</em>, a collaboration platform that connects interns and
      mentors through real-time data and intuitive design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about problem-solving, collaboration, and continuous
      learning. Every project I take on challenges me to think more critically,
      lead more effectively, and bridge the gap between data, design, and
      people. My goal isn’t just to become a developer — it’s to grow into a
      creative technologist who builds tools that empower others and make an
      impact.
    </p>
